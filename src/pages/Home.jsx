        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is David Carioto and I am a web developer.
           I graduated from the Montour School District in Pittsburgh,PA.
           I attained a BSBA with emphasis on Management Information Systems at Robert Morris College(now RMU).  After an extended time in the food industry as a General Manger, I realized my career needed to get back on track.  I am currently enrolled in a Web Developement Boot Camp through Penn LPS to reach a high level of performance, full stack, in this exciting industry. As a person who is seeking to always learn something new, I feel my continued developement is limitless.
