        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my profile page.</p>
        <p>My past education includes graduating from the Montour School District in Pittsburgh,PA., earning a BSBA with emphasis on Management Information Systems at Robert Morris College(now RMU), and, in 2024, completing a Full Stack Web Development BootCamp at PennU.</p>
        <p>Since then I have worked with the Python Programming Language and have had some interaction with Android Studio.  I have leveraged AI models to assist in scripting and found this to be very helpful in my work.  Most recently, I have focused on database products like PostgreSQL and SSMS, exploring the details of creating complex queries and maintaining database structures.</p>
        <p>After an extended time in the food industry as a General Manger, I desrire to move into a tech-driven or support industry, or a management position outside the food industry utilizing my current skills and greatly expanding on them quickly.
